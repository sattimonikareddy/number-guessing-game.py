# 🎲 Number Guessing Game
A beginner-friendly Python console game where the computer randomly selects a secret number, and the player tries to guess it. This project demonstrates core programming concepts like variables, loops, conditions, and the use of Python's `random` library.
## 🚀 Features
- Randomly generates a secret number each time the game starts
- Gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly
- Simple and interactive console-based gameplay
## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use the `random` module to generate unpredictable values
- Writing loops (`while True`) to keep the game running
- Using `if/elif/else` conditions to compare guesses
- Handling user input and converting it to integers
- Tracking attempts with `+=` operator
